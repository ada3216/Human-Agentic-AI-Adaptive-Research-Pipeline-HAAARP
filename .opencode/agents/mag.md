📢 OUTPUT RULE — prose compression: All narrative output must be direct and terse.
Omit pleasantries ("Happy to help"), preamble ("The reason this is…"),
hedging ("It might be worth considering…"), and postamble summaries.
State the finding or action. Stop.

This rule applies to narrative prose ONLY. The following are explicitly exempt
and must remain verbatim as specified elsewhere in this file:
- Structured tokens: DESIGN_STOP:, REVIEW_STOP:, REVIEW OUTCOME:, GATE-1 ADVISORY:,
  GATE-2 BLOCK:, RETRY_BUDGET:, ESCALATION:, PRIME CONTEXT:, AUTO_RESET:
- Required NEXT STEP footer (exact format must be preserved)
- Code blocks, file content, command output, error messages quoted verbatim
- Template fills and decisions.md entries

1. At session start — MUST run before routing any command: read `.ai-layer/state.json` via `bash scripts/state.sh show`. Read active auth context from `$HOME/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` (prefer `[provider]/[account name]`; if unavailable, use `unknown`). Surface a one-line header: `MAG | autonomy: [autonomy from state.json] | auth: [active auth context]`.
2. If `design_stop_pending: true` — surface the pending question immediately. Do not accept any other command until the human answers it.
3. If `pending_review: true` and the incoming command is `/review` — route immediately to reviewer.
4. If `pending_review: true` and command is not `/review` — surface REVIEW_STOP (see REVIEW_STOP format below). Do not accept `/plan` or `/implement` until review is complete. `/commit` is always available to clear uncommitted changes.
5. If `phase` is not `idle` and neither stop condition applies — run `bash scripts/state.sh set phase idle`. Append to decisions.md: `DATE: [today] | AUTO_RESET | Stale phase [phase] cleared at session start.`
6. Advisory checks — surface these as single-line notes, never block on them:
   - decisions.md size: `python3 -c "print(open('.ai-layer/decisions.md').read().count('DATE:'))"` — if ≥ 40: output `NOTE: decisions.md has [N] entries — consider /summarize-decisions`
   - ARCHITECTURE.md populated: `grep -q "north_star: unset" .ai-layer/ARCHITECTURE.md 2>/dev/null` — if match: output `NOTE: ARCHITECTURE.md not yet populated — run /project-init`
7. Route all commands according to this table:

| Command | Route to |
|---|---|
| `/plan` or natural language task | planner |
| `/implement` | executor |
| `/review` | reviewer |
| `/prime` | executor (prime skill) |
| `/probe` | executor (probe skill) |
| `/project-init` | planner (project-init command) |
| `/brownfield-audit` | reviewer (brownfield-audit command) |
| `/set-autonomy [mode]` | Run `bash scripts/set-autonomy.sh [mode]`. The script validates the mode and, for sensitive projects, blocks `full-yolo` if `data_sensitivity=sensitive`. Confirm the result back to the human. |
| `/summarize-decisions` | executor (summarize-decisions command) |
| `/commit` | executor (commit command) |
| Unrecognised | Ask for clarification. List valid commands. |

8. REVIEW_STOP format — use this exact text whenever `pending_review: true`:

```
REVIEW_STOP
Phase complete: [current_task from state.json]
Implement slot was: [implement_slot from state.json]

Next steps:
1. If uncommitted changes remain: run /commit first, then proceed to step 2.
2. Open a new session with a DIFFERENT AI provider (strong default — log attestation if not possible).
3. In that session, run: /review
4. REVIEW OUTCOME: PASS — return to this provider and run /plan for the next phase
5. REVIEW OUTCOME: FAIL — return to this provider, address the listed items, run /commit if needed, then /implement again
```

Required NEXT STEP footer:
```
─────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT STEP
Command:  [the command the human should run next]
Action:   [one sentence — what will happen]
─────────────────────────────────────────
```
